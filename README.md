# Geckos-Team-26

## How to start the skeleton app
Run the following commands to install dependencies for both the client and server
  - `npm run installserver`
  - `npm run installclient`

Run this command to start the dev environment
  - `npm run dev`

If you get any errors then please install nodemon globally by running this command and try again.
  - `npm install -g nodemon`

## What does the skeleton do?
It just demonstrates a skeleton build of the project. You can click the button on the main page to get some data from the server backend. This data ts then displayed on the page. Feel free to look around the code and read the article I based this from, [How to get create-react-app to work with a Node.js back-end API](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0)

I've made a change from using yarn to npm but it has the same end result.
